I'm a fourth year PhD student from School of EECE, University of Chinese Academy of Science. My research interest includes statistical signal processing, computer vision, statistical learning theory and deep learning theory.

I am very fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Maosheng Xiang](https://people.ucas.ac.cn/~xms) of National Key Laboratory of Microwave Imaging from School of EECE, University of Chinese Academy of Science.
